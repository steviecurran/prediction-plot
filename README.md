# prediction-plot
C (pgplot) code to plot predicted versus measured values (generated from Tensorflow)

Useful for large datasets, as produces a grey scale and error bars of equally binned data instead of individal points. 

Also returns a sub-plot showing the distribution of the difference in the predicted and measured values and gives the mean difference, the standard deviation and outlier fraction.
